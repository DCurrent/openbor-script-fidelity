/** Max Volume
* 
* This is the max volume engine allows for sound effects. 
* In theory we don't need this. The engine allows us to 
* read the menu option for sound volume. Unfortunatly there
* is a hidden hard coded volume cap applied to all sounds
* during playback. This is done for backward compatibility 
* with older modules, but it does present a problem for us.
* 
* Chiefly, the menu values are almost always much higher than 
* the hard code limit. As a result, our own calculations 
* might produce "low" values that also exceed the hard code 
* limit. When we play our sound, the engine subsequently 
* caps the playback volume and so our dynamic volume 
* calculations appear to fail.
* 
* To solve this problem, we include a value here that at time
* of writing is identical to engine’s hidden volume cap. When
* we request current volume level from the engine, we’ll cap 
* the result to this value before beginning any calculations. 
* This ensures our calculations stay within the engine cap 
* while also respecting player wishes if they set a lower 
* volume in the menu.
* 
* If later engine updates allow higher volume, we can increase 
* or eliminate this fix.

/** Sound Categories
*
* Normally sound categories are the name of a model. 
* When an entity is instructed to play
* a type of sound (see below), we use its base
* model name to select the category. This is not a 
* requirement though, it is just the default
* behavior. You can load sounds with any category 
* name you like and override the sound system's 
* automatic category selection when playing a 
* sound type.
*
* This is a list of predefined custom categories. 
* One example might be global whiff or hit sounds. 
* You aren't required to use this list when you 
* create custom categories, but it's a good idea 
* just to keep yourself organized. Add as many
* categories as you wish, just make sure they are 
* unique to each other and don't match any of your 
* model names.
*
* Note: DC_FIDELITY_CATEGORY_GLOBAL is a special category 
* used as a default fallback (you can switch this behavior 
* off). If a sound type does not exist for the requested 
* category, the sound system will look for that type in 
* the global category instead. If the type is not found 
* in global category either, no sound is played.

/** Sound Types
*
* Sound types are the specific types of sounds you 
* assign to each category (see above), and then instruct 
* the sound system to play. For instance, a model's
* voice effect when making a heavy attack. Each type 
* can be loaded mutiple times with different sound 
* files, in which case the sound will be picked 
* randomly each time the play function is executed.
*
* As with categories, feel free to create and use
* sound types at your discretion.
